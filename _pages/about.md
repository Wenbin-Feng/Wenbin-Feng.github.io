I'm a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at Shenzhen Technology University, majoring in computer science. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Lu Yu](https://lvyupku.github.io/) during my undergraduate journey. My research interests mainly lie in Computer Vision and NLP, specifically Object Segmentation and Medical Reports Generation, with the aims of improving accuracy by integrating and modifying advanced methods. My current research focuses on reinforce learning in medical reports generation.
