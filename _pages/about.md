I am a senior undergraduate at the Big Data and Internet College, Shenzhen Technology University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I am advised by Prof. [Yu Lu](https://lvyupku.github.io/).  
My research spans computer vision and natural language processing, with a focus on multi-modal learning for medical and industrial applications.

Research interests:
- Multi-modal representation learning (visionâ€“language contrastive learning)
- Object segmentation and fine-grained defect detection
- Medical report generation 
- Reinforcement learning for knowledge path retrieval
- Efficient training strategies (lightweight sequence models)

Currently, I work on GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework for knowledge path retrieval in medical report generation pipelines.
